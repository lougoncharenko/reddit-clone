# Reddit-Clone


## About this project
In this project, I develop a clone of Reddit with posts, subreddits, and authentication.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Implement a large scale application using Express, Handlebars, and MongoDB/Mongoose
2. Implement an authentication flow through JWTs that allows users to sign up, log in, and log out, and restricts functionality based on authentication status
3. Investigate how to use the populate method in Mongoose for advanced associations
4. Implement more intricate tests for CRUD apps as well as for authentication flows.
