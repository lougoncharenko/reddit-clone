# Reddit-Clone


## About this project
In this project, I develop a clone of Reddit with posts, subreddits, and authentication.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Implement a large scale application using Express, Handlebars, and MongoDB/Mongoose
2. Implement an authentication flow through JWTs that allows users to sign up, log in, and log out, and restricts functionality based on authentication status
3. Investigate how to use the populate method in Mongoose for advanced associations
4. Implement more intricate tests for CRUD apps as well as for authentication flows.

## User narratives

Fred signed up and made an account with nodeddit to be up-to-date with the latest news in regards to both business and fitness. Fred just started working out and has found it difficult to get information on what to do in the gym and which supplements to take. Fred uses this application to ask other gym goers what supplements they use and which programs they follow to build muscle.
